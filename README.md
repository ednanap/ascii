# ascii
ASCII is an abbreviation for the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
In brief, the ASCII table picks a numeric representation for each of a set of characters; for instance, the letter 'A' is given the code 65, 'B' is 66, and '^' is 94.
Text is stored in a computer as a sequence of numbers and then, when displayed, is translated from these numbers into visual representations of characters.

ASCII art is a term for the practice of using text to create images.
ASCIImation is the practice of using a repeated sequence of these textual images to create an animation using ASCII art. 
For this project, I created an ASCIImation player where textual images were played in faster frames per second to create a movie like effect.
I also created a code where these “movies” play in reverse.
